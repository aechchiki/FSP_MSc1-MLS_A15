First-Step Project

Group: Ian Sanders. Supervisor: Tania Wyss Lozano Hoyos

Project: Distribution of Genetic Polymorphism in Rhizophagus irregularis

Description: The aim of the project was to analyse the distribution of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in different isolates and genetic assemblies of the mychorrizal fungus R.irregularis, providing a preliminary insight on R. irregularis genetic features. We built a reference for future research aiming to infer the ecological significance of such polymorphisms. The experimental approach focused on the choice of appropriate existing analyzing tools and the development of a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze the genetic dataset. Programming tasks (Linux shell scripting), statistical data analysis (R) and pertinent biological interpretation were performed.

Additional information: The First-Step project is a research project offered by the School of Biology to Master Students. It takes place in the first semester, lasts for 10 weeks and provides an introduction to the individual Master research project.
